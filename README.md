# Mushroom Decision Tree
*This project was created as an assignment for the [Anson L. Clark Summer Research Program](https://honors.utdallas.edu/clark-summer-research-program) at the University of Texas at Dallas*

## Introduction
Prior to starting the program, the only computer science knowledge I had was how to print "Hello World!" I spent the first week
cramming python basics, learning how to code palindromes and how functions worked. The second week we were assigned a PhD-student level assignment.
As a beginner, the assignment was intimidating, but I managed to not only finish, but also create a GitHub repository and share it on GitHub. It took two months (with a 3 week break after the first month) but I still did it. If I can learn to use python, so can you! 

## Assignment

The goal was to implement a decision tree algorithim in python from scratch to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous by calculating information gain for each attribute to determine the best attribute to split on.
